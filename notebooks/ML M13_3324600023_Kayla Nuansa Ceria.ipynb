Pembagian Dataset**\n","Dataset dibagi menjadi:\n","- **80% data training**\n","- **20% data testing**\n","Menggunakan `train_test_split()` dengan `stratify=y` agar distribusi kelas tetap seimbang.\n","\n","## **3. Pembuatan dan Pelatihan Model**\n","Tiga model dasar berbasis Bagging dibangun:\n","\n","### **a. Decision Tree**\n","Model dasar sederhana berbasis pohon keputusan.

Evaluasi ROC/AUC**\n","Label pada dataset Iris memiliki 3 kelas.

Import Library dan Load Dataset**\n","Library yang digunakan mencakup:\n","- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → analisis dan visualisasi data.\n","- `sklearn` untuk preprocessing, splitting, model ML, evaluasi, serta pembuatan learning curve.\n","\n","Dataset Heart Attack dimuat menggunakan `pd.read_csv()`, kemudian ditampilkan ukuran dan contoh beberapa baris awal data.\n","\n","## **2. Data Preprocessing**\n","### **a. Pemeriksaan Missing Value**\n","Menggunakan `isnull().sum()` untuk memastikan semua kolom tidak memiliki data kosong.\n","\n","### **b. Pemeriksaan Tipe Data**\n","`info()` digunakan untuk memastikan format setiap kolom sesuai untuk pemodelan.\n","\n","### **c. Normalisasi Fitur**\n","Karena dataset memiliki skala numerik berbeda-beda:\n","- Fitur dinormalisasi menggunakan `StandardScaler()`\n","- Target `output` dipisahkan sebagai label\n","\n","Normalisasi penting untuk model berbasis jarak dan pohon ensemble modern.\n","\n","## **3. Pembagian Dataset**\n","Dataset dibagi menjadi:\n","- **80% data training**\n","- **20% data testing**\n","\n","Menggunakan `train_test_split()` dengan `stratify=y` agar proporsi kelas seimbang.\n","\n","## **4. Pembuatan dan Pelatihan Model**\n","Model Bagging yang digunakan sama seperti kasus Iris:\n","\n","### **a. Decision Tree**\n","Model dasar sebagai baseline.\n","\n","### **b. Random Forest**\n","Menggunakan banyak pohon keputusan untuk stabilitas prediksi.\n","\n","### **c. Extra Trees**\n","Mirip Random Forest namun lebih acak pada pemilihan threshold.\n","\n","Semua model dilatih dengan metode `.fit()`.\n","\n","## **5. Evaluasi Confusion Matrix**\n","Confusion matrix ditampilkan pada satu figure dengan tiga plot:\n","- Decision Tree\n","- Random Forest\n","- Extra Trees\n","\n","Label dirubah menjadi:\n","- `\"No Attack\"`\n","- `\"Attack\"`\n","\n","Dengan ini, evaluasi lebih mudah dipahami dalam konteks medis.\n","\n","## **6. ROC Curve dan AUC**\n","Untuk setiap model:\n","- Probabilitas kelas positif (`Attack`) diambil dari `predict_proba()[:,1]`\n","- ROC curve dihitung menggunakan `roc_curve()`\n","- AUC dihitung dengan `auc()`\n","\n","ROC/AUC memperlihatkan seberapa baik model membedakan antara pasien serangan jantung vs tidak.\n","\n","## **7. Learning Curve**\n","Learning curve dibuat untuk menganalisis:\n","- Stabilitas model\n","- Apakah model mengalami overfitting atau underfitting\n","- Seberapa besar data tambahan yang dibutuhkan\n","\n","Learning curve ditampilkan untuk:\n","- Decision Tree\n","- Random Forest\n","- Extra Trees\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"9-C8wz_63JLY"}}]}
